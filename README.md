### Final Report

During the summer 2019 Google Summer of Code, I worked with another GSoC participant P.Bhavasar to implement standard machine learning algorithms in swift for S4TF. 

I implemented the following algorithms:
```
- Decision Tree
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gradient Boost Regressor
- Random Forest 
- XGBoost (wrapper for the XGBoost library in Python)
- Support Vector Machine (wrapper for libSVM library in C)
```
